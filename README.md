## 🚀 About Me
I’m a graduate student at **Northeastern University** with hands-on experience building **AI-powered systems, cloud-native backends, and full-stack applications**.

My work focuses on **system design, data flow, and scalable architecture** — combining modern AI (LLMs, RAG, Graphs) with solid backend engineering and cloud practices.

I enjoy working on projects that involve **complex workflows, real-world data, and explainable outcomes**, especially in domains like **healthcare, insurance, and fitness**.
